                        <li><b>JAVA : </b>Java is a programming language and computing platform first released byjava Sun Microsystems in 1995. 
                            It has evolved from humble beginnings to power a large share of todayâ€™s digital world, by providing the reliable platform upon 
                            which many services and applications are built. New, innovative products and digital services designed for the future continue to rely on Java, as well.</li>
                            <br>
                          <li><b>C : </b>The C programming language is a procedural and general-purpose language that provides low-level access to system memory. A program written in 
                            C must be run through a C compiler to convert it into an executable that a computer can run. Many versions of Unix-based operating systems (OSes) are written in C 
                            and it has been standardized as part of the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX).</li>
                          <br>
                          <li><b>C++ : </b> is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

                            C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.
                            
                            C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.
