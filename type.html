                        <li>Low level: A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture commands or functions in the language map that are structurally similar to processor's instructions. Generally, this refers to either machine code or assembly language. Because of the low (hence the word) abstraction between the language and machine language, low-level languages are sometimes described as being "close to the hardware.</li>

                        <li>high level:The instructions that tell a computer what to do are written in machine code. Machine code is a series of numbers written in binary. Each number represents a different instruction.
                            Programmers find machine code difficult to learn, program in and debug. As a result, the majority of programmers write programs in high-level programming languages.  </li>

                        <li>Medium level:Medium-level language (MLL) is a computer programming language that interacts with the abstraction layer of a computer system. Medium-level language serves as the bridge between the raw hardware and programming layer of a computer system.

                            Medium-level language is also known as intermediate programming language and pseudo language.</li>
